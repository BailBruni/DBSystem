# Changes
There are many ways that this assignment can be modified.  One thing is that instead of saying that it should return null, to provide a default value such as 0.  With the provided code, java does not allow a function that returns an int to return null since its not an object.  Another thing that should be modified is to provide a better test file.  Mine just runs the things, but I had to modify for try and catch when I'm expecting an error, and I had to add the print functions
